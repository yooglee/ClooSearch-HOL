       "\n",
       "1. **Understanding the Purpose of Boundaries**: Boundaries help children to develop internal structure and responsibility. They provide a framework for safety until the child has enough internal structure to not need external enforcement<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Use of Discipline**: Discipline is an external boundary, designed to develop internal boundaries in children. Good discipline moves the child towards more internal structure and more responsibility<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[1]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Allowing Expression of Feelings**: Allow children to express their feelings and needs. This helps them understand that their experiences are different from others and helps them develop a sense of self<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[2]</a></sup>.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Gradual Shift of Responsibility**: Gradually shift the responsibility of meeting needs from the parents to the child. This helps children to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for their actions<sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/books/Boundaries_When_to_Say_Yes_How_to_Say_No_to_Take_Control_of_Your_Life.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2024-10-02T01:02:07Z&st=2023-08-03T17:02:07Z&spr=https&sig=gLxStXFSY6X29OPpPDpBEhoQDdtJNDrMVExNYJ%2BhmBQ%3D\" target=\"_blank\">[3]</a></sup>.\n",
